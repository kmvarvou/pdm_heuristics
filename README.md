# Evaluation of Heuristics for Product Data Models

The provided code provides an implementation for the approaches presented and evaluated in the following paper:

Konstantinos Varvoutas, Anastasios Gounaris: Evaluation of Heuristics for Product Data Models. In: International Conference on Business Process Management, pp. 355â€“366, Springer 2020. (https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-66498-5_26)

The heuristics were evaluated using two different Product Data Models (PDMs), which were implemented seperately. The PBWS folder corresponds to a mortage PDM (fig. 1 of the paper), while the PBWD folder corresponds to a social insurance PDM (fig. 2 of the paper).
